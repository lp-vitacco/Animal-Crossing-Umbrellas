# Animal-Crossing-Umbrellas

## Northeastern University Graduate Class Project 
### ARTG:5330 Visualization Technologies 1 

Visualization technologies 1 focused on skills necessary for engineering visualization using code. This course focused on R and D3.js. R allowed students to analyze, transform, and clean data, while D3.js created data-driven visualization for the web. The class first focused on understanding data, so you could create interesting graphs and analyses later on in the semester. Other languages such as, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, were used when designing the graphs and information in an online format. 

The code displayed here is from the final project for the course.

#### Final Project 

The final focused on designing a webpage with interactive data with D3.js. I took the pricing of umbrellas in the Nitendo video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I created a scatter plot using svgs in D3.js. I also created a tooltip, for hovering over the data point in the graph. When you hovered over the plots you can see the buying and selling price of each umbrella. I also took graphics of Animal Crossing: New Horizon characters and edited the files in Adobe Illustrator to make them vector images. 

In order to see the interactive graph you have to run the script on a sever. 

All images are owned by Nitendo.

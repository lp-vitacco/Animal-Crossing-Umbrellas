```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


library(tidyverse)
umbrellas <- read_csv("./data/umbrellas.csv")

```


``` {r}

 

final.umbrellas <- umbrellas[!duplicated(umbrellas$Buy), ] %>% 
  filter(DIY == "No") %>%
  

write.csv(final.umbrellas, "final.umbrellas.csv")



```














Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
